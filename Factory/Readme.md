# Factory pattern
In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to client and the client use the same common interface to create new type of object.
As in this example, moving of your client to a new configuration mechanism over the life of the software does not affect the client code. 
Adding of new config mechnism only needs adding of a new code and making change in one single method.
