## Intent

## Code Example

## Mapping the UML classes to Example code

## Points to Remember
Downsides
The process of copying an object can be complicated.
Classes that have circular references to other classes are difficult to clone.
Overuse of the pattern could affect performance, as the prototype object itself would need to be instantiated if you use a registry of prototypes.
